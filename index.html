        <div class="question">What is the return policy?</div>
        <div class="answer">We do not accept returns of used or worn items, unless the reason for return is that the item stopped working or became damaged or defective after reasonable use (in accordance with manufacturers guidelines where applicable) during the returns period. Items becoming defective after delivery is not an applicable return reason in respect of the following product categories: clothing, sport & fitness and consumables. If an item is covered by a warranty, and becomes damaged or defective during the warranty period, it is not covered by this Returns and Refunds Policy, but by the seller warranty. Warranty information is displayed on each product page.</div>

        <div class="question">What do people like in 2024?</div>
        <div class="answer">Artificial Intelligence (tie for #1)
            AI is the new electricity of our era. It's transforming everything from recruitment to compensation. Across the 15 trend lists we reviewed, AI was most connected to recruitment (dually affecting candidates and employers), how we maximize talent, skills and learning and development, and emerging ways we leverage fractional roles and the gig economy. Without question, as we've seen in the final days of 2023 with the New York Times copyright suit against OpenAI, this will be a year of unexpected change for how we connect and regulate this technology. Artificial intelligence will make defining what is human, and creating positive experiences through tech (whether through the candidate or employee experiences) even more critical in the marketplace.</div>
